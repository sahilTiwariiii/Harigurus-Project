tell me yes or no useLocation is the part of react or javascript?

No, `useLocation` is not a part of React or JavaScript itself. It is a hook provided by the **React Router** library (`react-router-dom`), which is commonly used for handling routing in React applications.


`useLocation` is **not a part of React itself**, but rather a part of **React Router**, which is a separate library built on top of React. React Router is used for managing navigation and routing in React applications. 

So, while `useLocation` is used in React projects, it's not directly part of React coreâ€”it's part of the `react-router-dom` package.
