tell me yes or no useLocation is the part of react or javascript?

No, `useLocation` is not a part of React or JavaScript itself. It is a hook provided by the **React Router** library (`react-router-dom`), which is commonly used for handling routing in React applications.


`useLocation` is **not a part of React itself**, but rather a part of **React Router**, which is a separate library built on top of React. React Router is used for managing navigation and routing in React applications. 

So, while `useLocation` is used in React projects, it's not directly part of React core—it's part of the `react-router-dom` package.

To add a heading to your page using **React Helmet** in the `Copyright` component, here's how you can modify it:




### About Your Doubt:  
If your whole component is inside the `<Helmet>` tag and the **React Helmet** package terminates or is removed, **your React app won't terminate**. Only the title and meta description won't be dynamically updated, but the rest of the component (HTML and functionality) will work as normal. React Helmet just modifies the `<head>` section of the HTML, so it's not critical to the app’s core functionality.
