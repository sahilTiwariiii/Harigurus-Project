## 🌐 SEO (Search Engine Optimization) Using React Helmet

React Helmet is used to dynamically change the document title and meta tags based on the content. This enhances the website's SEO, ensuring better visibility in search engine results.

### ⚠️ Important Note
If **React Helmet** is removed, the website will still work, but dynamic changes to the `<head>` section (title, meta description) will no longer function. This will impact SEO but not the core application’s performance.
